### Hi there, Am Dr. Abiira NathanðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack web dev with burning desire to effect the world not only by injecting people but by pressing the key board for longer than palatable!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a django rest authentication package. Check it out [Here](https://github.com/abiiranathan/drf-authtoken "DRF Rest API Authentication")
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GO and the popular GORM ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” If you need help with python, JavaScript,Java and web technologies, I can probably help. I have built a couple of small and giant(in my opinion) projects in      React. A large Electronic Health management system written in typescriptreact with djangorestframework API is probably my biggest project.
- I have also worked on other private projects like **Medical File Yo** that deals with Storage of patient records.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything python, JS,React,Go,Java.
- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on twitter and give me a follow. I post deep thoughts about code and sarcasm!
- âš¡ Fun fact: **I sleep 6 hours a day...That's quite unhealthy!**
